                    adventourous girl, who loves to travel different places. If i would to choose my home country and foreign country
                    , my choice will be foreign country as l am always keen to learn about other countries culture, heritage
                    amd rituals. In my opinion exploring and seeking knowledge from unique places is perfectly fun job. I love travelling 
                    for fun and enjoyment and whenever i hear about, I always get a excited. eventually, Travelling is bissful to me.</p>

                <p>Website develipment is a rewarding intrest that one can have in order to develop their skills. It is a professional 
                    type of programming. Very few people find fun in deveopment of website and it helps me to learn new things which
                    is absolutely fun for me. I have been intrested in programming for last two years and i started with languages HTML and CSS 
                    currently i am also learning PHP and JavaScript. I started learning website development as an intrest but now i am 
                    getting keen to learn this as it grow intrest of one in future in their career too, as my career is related to technology
                     and i feel blissful learning the same.
